### Count the number of aisles and the aisles with most items ordered

Count the number of aisles in the dataset:

``` r
n_distinct(instacart$aisle)
```

    ## [1] 134

Count the number of orders in each aisle and sort by descending order:

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n())|>
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                          n_obs
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Therefore, there are 134 aisles. The most items are ordered from fresh
vegetables aisles.

### Plot: the number of items ordered in each aisle (aisles with more than 10000 items ordered)

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n()) |>
  filter(n_obs > 10000) |>
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, desc(n_obs))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +  # Use geom_bar for a bar chart
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

### Table: the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits” with the number of times each item is ordered

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
