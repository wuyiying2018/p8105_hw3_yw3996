### Count the number of aisles and the aisles with most items ordered

Count the number of aisles in the dataset:

``` r
n_distinct(instacart$aisle)
```

    ## [1] 134

Count the number of orders in each aisle and sort by descending order:

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n())|>
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                          n_obs
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Therefore, there are 134 aisles. The most items are ordered from fresh
vegetables aisles.
