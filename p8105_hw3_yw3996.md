        the past, 0 otherwise
    -   `user_id`: customer identifier
    -   `eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note
        that the data for use in this class is exclusively from the
        “train” eval_set)
    -   `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user
        (1=first, n=nth)
    -   `order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed
    -   `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was

    -   `aisle_id`: aisle identifier
    -   `department_id`: department identifier
    -   `aisle`: the name of the aisle
    -   `department`: the name of the department

### Count the number of aisles and the aisles with most items ordered

Count the number of aisles in the dataset:

``` r
n_distinct(instacart$aisle)
```

    ## [1] 134

Count the number of orders in each aisle and sort by descending order:

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n())|>
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                          n_obs
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Therefore, there are 134 aisles. The most items are ordered from fresh
vegetables aisles.

### Plot 1

the number of items ordered in each aisle (aisles with more than 10000
items ordered)

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n()) |>
  filter(n_obs > 10000) |>
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, desc(n_obs))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +  # Use geom_bar for a bar chart
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

### Table 1

the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”,
“dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits” with the number of
times each item is ordered

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |

### Table 2

the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream
are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers
(i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "order_dow", 
    values_from = "mean_hour")|>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## 2. BRFSS data

load the data from the p8105.datasets using:

``` r
data("BRFSS")
brfss=brfss_smart2010
```

First, do some data cleaning:

-   format the data to use appropriate variable names;
-   focus on the “Overall Health” topic
-   include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
-   organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
    “Excellent”
