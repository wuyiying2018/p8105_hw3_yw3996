## 1. Instacart data

load the data from the p8105.datasets using:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
instacart=instacart
```

### Description of the dataset

-   This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
    resprenting a single product from an instacart order.

-   Variables include

    -   `order_id`: order identifier
    -   `product_id`: product identifier
    -   `add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added to
        cart
    -   `reordered`: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in
        the past, 0 otherwise
    -   `user_id`: customer identifier
    -   `eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note
        that the data for use in this class is exclusively from the
        “train” eval_set)
    -   `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user
        (1=first, n=nth)
    -   `order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed
    -   `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was
        placed
    -   `days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at
        30, NA if order_number=1

### Count the number of aisles and the aisles with most items ordered

Count the number of aisles in the dataset:

``` r
n_distinct(instacart$aisle)
```

    ## [1] 134

Count the number of orders in each aisle and sort by descending order:

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n())|>
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                          n_obs
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Therefore, there are 134 aisles. The most items are ordered from fresh
vegetables aisles.

Comments:

The bar chart depicted above illustrates the quantity of items requested
from various store aisles, specifically focusing on those aisles with an
order count exceeding 10,000 items. The aisles have been organized in a
descending order according to their respective item counts, simplifying
the identification of the most frequented sections. The fresh vegetables
aisle emerges as the most popular, boasting the highest item order
count, followed by the fresh fruits and packaged vegetables fruits
sections. Conversely, aisles like oils vinegars, dry pasta, canned meals
beans, and butter exhibit the lowest order counts among the ones
presented. Nonetheless, even these less popular sections still manage to
accumulate more than 10,000 orders.

## 2. BRFSS data

load the data from the p8105.datasets using:

``` r
data("BRFSS")
brfss=brfss_smart2010
```

### data cleaning

-   format the data to use appropriate variable names;
-   focus on the “Overall Health” topic
-   include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
-   organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
    “Excellent”

list all the value of response column:

``` r
brfss=brfss|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(data_value=as.double(data_value))
unique(brfss$response)
```

    ##  [1] "Excellent"                                 
    ##  [2] "Very good"

dat = brfss|>
  filter(response=="Excellent")|>
  group_by(year, locationabbr)|>
  summarize(data_value_mean=mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

### spaghetti plot

``` r
dat|>
  rename("state"="locationabbr")|>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = data_value_mean, 
             color =state )) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 5))
```

Comments:

-   In both 2006 and 2010, the “Poor” responses exhibit the lowest
    median data values, and the “Good”, “Very Good”, and “Excellent”
    responses tend to have significantly higher data values compared to
    those with “Poor” or “Fair” responses.
-   The “Fair” responses in 2010 have a greater variation compared to
    those in 2002.
-   The “Good” responses in 2010 have smaller variation compared to
    those in 2002.
-   The “Very Good” responses in 2010 have a higher median and larger
    variation compared to those in 2002.

Comments:

There are 6 counties responded in 2006, while 9 counties in 2010. The
overall distribution seems consistent between two years, while there is
variation among counties.

## 3. Accelerometer data

import dataset

``` r
demographic=read_csv("./data/nhanes_covar.csv",skip = 4)|>
  janitor::clean_names()
accelerometer=read_csv("./data/nhanes_accel.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names()
```

### data cleaning

clean `demographic` dataset:

-   include all originally observed variables;
-   exclude participants less than 21 years of age, and those with
    missing demographic data; and
-   encode data with reasonable variable classes

``` r
demographic=demographic|>
  drop_na()|>
  filter(age>=21,!is.na(sex), !is.na(age), !is.na(bmi), !is.na(education))|>
  mutate(
     sex=case_match(
       sex,
       1~"male",
       2~"female"),
     education=case_match(
       education,
       1~"Less than high school",
       2~"High school equivalent",
       3~"More than high school"
     ),
     education=factor(education, levels=c(
       "Less than high school",
       "High school equivalent",
       "More than high school"))
  )
```

clean `accelerometer` data

-   pivot longer

``` r
accelerometer=accelerometer|>
  drop_na()|>
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "time", 
    values_to = "mims_value")|>
  separate(time,into=c("min","minute"),3)|>
  select(-min)|>
  mutate(minute=as.integer(minute))
```

join `accelerometer` with `demographic`

``` r
dat_3=
  inner_join(demographic,accelerometer,by="seqn")
```

### table for the number of men and women in each education category

``` r
dat_3|>
  group_by(sex,education) |> 
  summarize(n_obs = n_distinct(seqn)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = education, values_from = n_obs)|>
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

| sex    | Less than high school | High school equivalent | More than high school |
|:-------|----------------------:|-----------------------:|----------------------:|
| female |                    28 |                     23 |                    59 |
| male   |                    27 |                     35 |                    56 |

Comments:

-   Among both genders, the “More than high school” education category
    has the highest count, indicating that a significant portion of the
    sampled population has education beyond high school.
-   In the “High school equivalent” category, there are slightly more
    males (35) than females (23).
-   The counts in “Less than high school” category are close, with 28
    females and 27 males.

### visualization of the age distributions for men and women in education category

``` r
dat_3 |> 
  group_by(education,seqn)|>
  distinct(seqn,sex,age,education)|>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = education)) +

  facet_grid(.~sex)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_yw3996_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="90%" />
Comments:

-   Among both genders, the age distributions for “More than high
    school” education category are right-skewed, while age distributions
    for “Less than high school” education category are left-skewed,
    indicating that young people tend to have higher education levels.
-   The difference of the distributions among education categories for
    female is more significant than that of male group. This suggests
    that gender may play a role in shaping educational attainment
    patterns, with females showing a greater variation in age across
    education levels.

### analysis total activity variable for each participant

create a total activity variable for each participant

``` r
total_act=dat_3|>
  group_by(seqn,sex,age,bmi,education)|>
  summarise(total_activity=sum(mims_value))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'seqn', 'sex', 'age', 'bmi'. You can
    ## override using the `.groups` argument.

Plot these total activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis)

``` r
total_act|>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .75)+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_grid(.~education)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

Comments:

-   Overall, both young females and young males tend to have higher
    total activities in all education groups.
-   For “High school equivalent” and “More than high school” groups, the
    total activities for females are slightly higher than those for
    males.
-   Since there are a lot of overlap between the confidence intervals
    between females and males for all education groups, total activities
    is not statistically significant difference between the genders
    across these education categories.
-   Both females and males tend to have a smaller variation of total
    activities in ages within the ‘More than high school’ education
    category compared to the other two education categories.

### Inspection activity over the course of the day

three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each
education level and use color to indicate sex:

``` r
dat_3|>
  group_by(minute, sex, education)|>
  summarise(mims_value=mean(mims_value))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = mims_value, color = sex)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .75)+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_grid(.~education)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'minute', 'sex'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

Comments:

-   Overall, both females and males tend to have higher MIMS values from
    8:30 to 20:00 (i.e. 510\~1200 minute) in all education groups.
-   MIMS values will increase dramatically since 4:00, and reach the
    peak at around 8:30. Then it will decrease slightly from 8:30 to
    20:00, and drop dramatically after 20:00.
-   Both females and males tend to have higher peak MIMS values within
    the ‘Less than high school’ education category compared to the other
    two education categories. This suggests that educational attainment
    may be associated with differences in peak MIMS values, with lower
    education levels potentially correlating with higher peak MIMS
    scores.
-   For “High school equivalent” and “More than high school” groups,
    females tend to have higher MIMS values than males from 8:30 to
    20:00 while MIMS values are similar between genders in ‘Less than
    high school’ education category.
